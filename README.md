## üìù About Me
Hello, I'm Ashley, and this is my GitHub account with all my projects. I like music, tech in general and cats.

My hobbies consist of:
 - Listening to music ([Here are my horrible music choices put on a pretty graph](https://ys.fwuffyboi.ml/?gname=Last+week&token=6e3b2f41-968d-4c5a-897e-97aa60f033b5))
 - Watching films/TV shows (my fav show is "How to sell drugs online (fast)")
 - Server administration and running my own services

## üñ•Ô∏è What equipment I use:
 - 1x Raspberry pi 4B+ 4GB ram
 - 1x Raspberry pi 4B+ 4GB ram with Argon40 EON NAS case
 - Thinkpad T480s with EndeavourOS
 - Pixel 6a with GrapheneOS

## üóÉÔ∏è Contacts
I am contactable on Discord and by email. Either is fine, however discord is checked more often, and I will reply quicker.
