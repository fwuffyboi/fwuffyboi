## üìù About Me
Hello, I'm Ashley, and this is my GitHub account with all my projects. I like music, tech in general and cats.
I control and manage the domain names and servers behind:
 - Skrunkle.cloud
 - Fwuffyboi.xyz

My hobbies consist of:
 - Listening to music ([Here are my horrible music preferences from the past week laid out onto a pretty (selfhosted) graph](https://ys.fwuffyboi.xyz/all?gname=Last+week&token=6447610b-c711-4de0-ba1c-b761a2f0ca15))
 - Watching films/TV shows (my fav shows are "How to sell drugs online (fast)", and "Money Heist")
 - Learning about Server administration and cybersecurity

## üñ•Ô∏è What equipment I use:
 - 1x Raspberry pi 4B+ 4GB ram
 - 1x Raspberry pi 4B+ 4GB ram with Argon40 EON NAS case
 - Thinkpad T480s with Fedora Workstation
 - Pixel 6a with GrapheneOS

## üóÉÔ∏è Contacts
I am contactable on Discord and by email. Either is fine, however discord is checked more often, and I will reply quicker.
